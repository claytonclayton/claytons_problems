    You find a sheet of paper with a grid of numbers $G$ of size $R \times C$ written on it. You fold the paper so that when you unfold it, all numbers are surrounded by fold lines (corner numbers have two adjacent fold lines, edge numbers have 3 adjacent fold lines and inner numbers are surrounded on all sides by 4 adjacent fold lines). For each number you add to it the number of mountain folds it is adjacent to. Is there a series of folds so that all numbers in the resulting grid are even? <br>

    Subtask-1 - Assume the paper is always folded with alternating folds starting with U i.e U -> L -> U -> L ... <br>
    Subtask-2 - The paper can be folded with arbitrary folds <br> 
</p>

<p>
    Output a series of folds where each fold is of the form UV, UM, LV or LM. <br>
    Copied from paper question from IMC contest.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Up Valley (<code class="d-inline-block">UV</code>).
        This fold is performed by taking the bottom of the paper and folding it towards you and up onto the front facing side.
        This would result in a horizontal valley crease when unfolded.
    </li>
    <li>
        Up Mountain (<code class="d-inline-block">UM</code>).
        This fold is performed by taking the bottom of the paper and folding it away from you and up onto the back facing side.
        This would result in a horizontal mountain crease when unfolded.
    </li>
    <li>
        Left Valley (<code class="d-inline-block">LV</code>).
        This fold is performed by taking the right side of the paper and folding it towards you and left onto the front facing side.
        This would result in a vertical valley crease when unfolded.
    </li>
    <li>
        Left Mountain (<code class="d-inline-block">LM</code>).
        This fold is performed by taking the right side of the paper and folding it away from you and left onto the back facing side.
        This would result in a vertical mountain crease when unfolded.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>
    The first line contains integers $R$ and $C$ representing the row size and column size of the grid respectively. $R$ and $C$ are guaranteed to be powers of 2. <br>
    Next follows $R$ lines each with $C$ integers where the $j^{th}$ integer on the $i^{th}$ line represents the integer in row $i$ and column $j$. 
</p>
<p>
    You should read from standard input.
</p>   

<h4>Constraints</h4>
<p>For all test cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$2 \le R, C \le 1024$.</li>
    <li>$R$ and $C$ are powers of 2</li>
    <li>0 \le $G_{ij}$ \le 100</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For 50% of test cases, you can assume the paper was folded with alternating folds starting from U.</li>
    <li>For 50% of test cases, there are no additional constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>
    If there is a valid folding, then the first line will contain YES, then the next line will be an integer $m$ representing the number of folds required. <br>
    The next $m$ lines will contain one of UM, UV, LM or LV. <br>
    If there is no valid folding, then output NO.
</p>
<p>
    You should write to standard output.
